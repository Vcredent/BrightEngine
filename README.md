## Build environment requirements

------------

- `MinGW` or other toolchains
- `CMake`

The IDE Notice:

- `CLion`

    if you use `CLion` IDE, you don't need to do anything, you can run the project directly after opening it.

- `Visual Studio`

    if you use `Visual Studio` IDE, i'm not sure if you can run the project directly after opening it, You might need to configure some environments or libraries.
    but in my machine i can directly after opening it and don't need configuration for anything.

## Build environment requirements

------------

- `MinGW`
- `CMake`
- `Vulkan SDK`

The IDE:

- `CLion`

    if you use `CLion` IDE you don't need to do anything, you can run the project directly after opening it.

- `Visual Studio`

    if you use `Visual Studio` i'm not sure if you can run the project directly opening it, maybe you should configure some environments or libraries.
